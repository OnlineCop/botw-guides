# Apparatus Storage

An apparatus is a device within a handful of shrines that Link activates in order to control some kind of platform by tilting the player's controller.

By carefully manipulating Link's animations and menu inputs, the player may confuse the game's state so viewing a Memory can cause:

## Pros
- Any heart/stamina "essence" stored with the Horned Statue in Hateno Village are preserved through reloads.
- Environmental effects are disabled: Link won't suffer from extreme heat/cold in deserts, snowy areas, or Death Mountain.
- Elemental effects are disabled: Link cannot be shocked, catch on fire, or freeze.

## Cons
- Falling with the paraglider activated does not slow Link's descent (much).
- The arrow duplication glitch, where normal arrows shot from a multi-shot bow through certain torches/campfires, is disabled; only 1 arrow is dropped.

# Requirements

Link needs the Camera Rune, at least one Memory, any shield, and at least one Material.

1. Select the Camera Rune, and equip the shield.
1. Hold [ZL] so Link holds the shield in front of him, and enter both of these inputs simultaneously: `[L]` (bumper) and `(L)-click` (press analog stick down like a button)
    - You should be in a state where you are looking through the camera, Link is crouched, and you can still move around.
1. Walk to the Apparatus control and press `(A)` to both activate it and take a picture with the Camera Rune.
1. It will prompt you to save or delete the picture: choose the Delete option.
    - Immediately after selecting Delete, it will close the menu/prompt.
1. Press `[+]` as quickly as possible to re-open the menu.
1. Hold any Material.
1. Press `[+]` twice quickly: once to close the menu, and once again to reopen it.
    - This should be done before the Apparatus platform takes control (and tilting the player's controller manipulates the platform).
1. Switch to the Memories, and view any one of them.
    - The memory should not actually play.
1. Wait 3 or more seconds, then press `[+]` to close the menu.
    - You should be able to control the platform (tilting the controller) at the same time that Link can walk around.
