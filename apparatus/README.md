# Apparatus Storage

An apparatus is a device within a handful of shrines that Link activates in order to control some kind of platform by tilting the player's controller.

By carefully manipulating Link's animations and menu inputs, the player may confuse the game's state so viewing a Memory can cause:

## Pros
- Any heart/stamina "essence" stored with the Horned Statue in Hateno Village are preserved through reloads.
- Environmental effects are disabled: Link won't suffer from extreme heat/cold in deserts, snowy areas, or Death Mountain.
- Elemental effects are disabled: Link cannot be shocked, catch on fire, or freeze.

## Cons
- Falling with the paraglider activated does not slow Link's descent (much).
- The arrow duplication glitch, where normal arrows shot from a multi-shot bow through certain torches/campfires, is disabled; only 1 arrow is dropped.

# Requirements

Link needs the Camera Rune, and at least one Memory.
