# Keeping the Bow of Light (advanced method)

There is an alternate way to keep the Bow of Light that uses Prompt Entanglement instead of an inventory nuke. Compared to the [main](Keeping%20the%20Bow%20of%20Light.md) method, this method has:

### Advantages

- Requires less offset. (works well with K+1, or can be as low as 1).
- Quite tolerant of dying in the Ganon fights.
- Doesn't require huge offset calculation that can silently be not enough.
- Doesn't require closing and reopening the game.
- Quicker to do, with proficiency.
- Arguably more fun to watch.

### Disadvantages

- Requires knowledge of Prompt Entanglement.
- Somewhat arduous with Arrow PE (although not impossible, and you can de-dupe the arrow slots before entering the Sanctum and hold on to the System tab invalid slot).
- Annoying with high arrow counts that are still less than 500.

## Overview

The PE method looks like this:

1. Reduce your inventory in a manner similar to the main guide.
1. Defeat Blights and Calamity Ganon, then enter DBG and pick up the BoL.
1. Use PE and specially arranged Materials and Food tabs to eat all arrows, armor and key items that are in the way and a duplication risk.
1. Reload directly into the target save file.

## Preparation

1. Ensure your target manual save has at least one free bow slot in it.
1. Ensure all 7 tabs have been discovered.
1. Do any other general-purpose battle prep you want, as outlined in the main guide.
1. Get [Star Icon Invalid Slot with 1 offset](../pe/SIIS%201%20Offset.md).
1. Cook as many meals as you want. You will need to have at least 4 meals.
1. Ensure your arrow stacks are each no higher than 100 (quicker to X-haul), or well above 500 (will not duplicate, even after heavy use against a boss).
1. Reduce your materials so that the tab contains the following:
	1. 20 slots (a full single page) of edible materials, each of a quantity between 2 and 10.
	1. A stack of fairies, no greater than 20. (Fairies count as 'edible' for PE, so it's okay if they appear mixed in with your other edibles).
	1. A 1x stack of Wood.
1. Choose one set of armor to use during the Ganon fights and get rid of the rest:
	1. Sell what you can.
	1. You can get rid of unsellable armor you don't want by entangling a Food prompt and eating it.
1. Use your page of edible Materials to eat any Key Items that don't match any of the following:
	- Champion Powers;
	- The Travel Medallion, if you want to re-position it while reaching the Sanctum;
	- Any stackable Key Item (Korok Seeds, Spirit Orbs, Champion Emblems) with a quantity of 500 or more.

	If you have 2 pages of food, you won't get the right page alignment to do this. You can fix that like so:

	1. Drop one stack of edible materials.
	1. Drop the bundle of Wood.
	1. Use the new alignment to eat whatever Key Items you need.
	1. Pick the edible materials back up again.
	1. Pick the Wood back up again.

1. Sell any food with a high quantity (roasted, frozen, corrupted meals).
1. Get an autosave with this inventory.
1. Increase your 1 offset to cover K+1 slots, plus any 700+ arrow stacks.
1. Reload the last autosave.

## Ganon

If you die during any of the Blight/Calamity fights, you can reload your last autosave and keep playing. However, if you do this, you should eat any dupes of upgraded Champion Powers you might have.

1. Enter the Sanctum and pause after the first round of cutscenes.
1. Entangle food prompts to eat all armor. (Link will continue to wear the armor, and get any status effects from it.)
1. Defeat Calamity Ganon (and any Blights that appear) in the Sanctum.
	- As before, you can use any weapons, bows, and shields in these fights.
	- You can use arrows, as long as you don't pull any large arrow stacks below 500.
	- You can eat any food, now that your inventory has no armor in it.
	- You can use fairies, but do not touch the other materials.

## Dark Beast

1. Enter the Dark Beast Ganon fight and pick up the Bow of Light.
1. Jump off your horse and stand on the ground, so that Link is willing to hold things, and pause.
1. X-haul and eat your low arrow stacks:
	1. Find the material on the first page of your Materials tab that occupies the same row and column as the arrow stack.
	1. Get the cursor on that cell in an off-screen page, and make sure it isn't desynced.
	1. Page over to entangle the prompt (central page should be Shields or Weapons), press X, and press A repeatedly.
	1. Keep pressing A until the stack quantity is 1 or 0.
	1. Once the quantity is this low, press X to stop holding, and press A to eat the slot.
	1. Repeat for the other low arrow stacks.
1. Drop any bows to the right of the BoL.
1. Drop all shields.
1. Eat all food.
1. Eat/drop all materials.
1. Reload the target manual save to transfer the BoL.

## Transfer and commit

1. If the final inventory looks good. **unpause, pause again** and manually save to preserve it.
1. _(optional)_ Close the game to clear offset.
