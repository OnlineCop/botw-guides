Dropping (and destroying) the Bow of Light with PE

- Set up star slot
- Get a material 3 pages (or 6, or 9) to the right of the Bows tab, in the same row/column as the BoL (assuming row 1, column 1, because getting the BoL there is easy)
- Stand on flat ground where Link is willing to hold materials
- Unequip the BoL and equip any weapon
- Unpause, wait a few seconds, pause
- Entangle the material prompt onto the Bow of Light
- Turn the game volume DOWN or OFF
- Press A at least 11 times
- Unpause (this will play 10 weapon break noises at the same time)
- No more BoL
